EasyXdcc
========

XDCC download manager with support for simultaneous queues on different channels, servers and bots, as well as saving/loading queue state.

__Current Version: 1.3__ ([changelog](#changelog))

## Credit

This is not my work, I just found it and made some modifications. The site seems to be down even though the file is still accessible and searching for an hour today looking for an updated version returned nothing helpful, so I decided to host it here.

The original is by Bouliere Tristan and can be found in the [XChat plugin repository](http://xchat.org/cgi-bin/search.pl?str=easyxdcc&cat=0&Submit=Search). I attempted to email Bouliere using the address given in the source code to tell him about this repo, but I got a bounceback saying it didn't exist.

## Install

Simply copy `EasyXdcc.py` to your IRC client's plugins folder. Original version designed for XChat 2, my version is tested and working in HexChat 2.10.1. May or may not work in any other client.

Confirm it is loaded and active in your client's plugin manager.

:shipit:

## Usage

Make sure you have joined a channel with access to the bot you want files from, then use one of the following commands:

* `/XDCC ADD [bot_name] [n°_pack]`
* `/XDCC ADDL [bot_name] [n°_pack_beg] [n°_pack_end]`
* `/XDCC ADDM [bot_name] [n°_pack_1] [n°_pack_2] [...]`

You can use `/XDCC QUEUE` or `/XDCC QUEUE [bot_name]` to view the current queue.

If it doesn't start downloading stuff for you automatically enter `/XDCC START` to get things going. To make it start downloading automatically in the future, enter `/XDCC AUTO ON` or toggle it form the EasyXdcc menu option.

The start/stop/auto-start and load/save/show queue functions are also available from a custom menu added to your client's interface. Additionally, the menu entry for auto-start will tell you whether the feature is currently on or off.
